# About the Project

The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive catalog of freshwater aquarium fish, providing detailed
information on their characteristics and care. The catalog includes information on feeding, care, breeding, and useful tips for each fish.

The project started in July 2024 with the aim of allowing anyone to share essential information. The project is based
on an open repository with Markdown files, enabling anyone to make changes to the catalog and share their experiences.
The catalog covers all species and varieties of freshwater fish available in the aquarium trade, highlighting their
unique features and requirements.

I started developing this catalog from scratch, driven by a passion for aquaristics and a desire to support aquarists
in creating the best conditions for their pets. The first version of the website with the fish catalog was published
in 2024, and since then, I have dedicated my time and knowledge to expanding the database, continuously researching
and adding new data to ensure the catalog remains a valuable resource for aquarists of all levels.

## How We Differ from Other Projects

Our project is based on open-source principles and uses the Markdown format, making it unique among similar resources.
This approach allows independent aquarists to easily control and enhance the content, creating a high-quality knowledge
base about the most popular freshwater fish in aquaristics. By storing all articles and source files in
an [open repository](https://github.com/Nepsha1986/handbook-freshwater-fish), anyone can contribute to the project
or use the content for their own purposes.

We welcome contributions to our freshwater aquarium fish catalog! At this stage, only registered GitHub users can edit
and add content. If you are not registered on GitHub but wish to help improve our project, please feel free to contact
me directly at nepsha1986@gmail.com.

Additionally, if you photograph aquarium fish and are willing to share high-quality images, we would be delighted to
publish them on our website.
